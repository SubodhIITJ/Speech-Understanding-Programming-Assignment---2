Speaker Separation, Identification, and Enhancement Pipeline

Overview
This project implements a novel pipeline, SepID-Enhance, combining speaker separation (using SepFormer), speaker identification (using WavLM Base Plus), and speech enhancement. Additionally, it includes a language classification module using MFCC features extracted from the "Audio Dataset with 10 Indian Languages." The pipeline is fine-tuned on a custom multi-speaker dataset derived from VoxCeleb2 and evaluated on various metrics.
